# React Quiz App

This is a project for practice. The app shows a few default questions, a hidden answer that can be seen by clicking the respective button and different navigation methods. New questions can be added through a form. Questions can also be filtered by bookmarking them and by adding tags. When you click at a tag the app shows all questions with that tag.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
